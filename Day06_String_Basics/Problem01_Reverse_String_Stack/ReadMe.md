# Reverse a String using Stack

## Description

This Python program reverses a user-input string using a **stack data structure**. It simulates the stack's Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) behavior to reverse the characters of the string.

## Features

- Accepts a string from the user.
- Uses a stack (Python list) to reverse the string.
- Displays the reversed string.

## How It Works

1. The input string is converted into a list (used as a stack).
2. Characters are popped from the stack and appended to a new string.
3. The result is a reversed version of the original string.

## Example

Enter the String: hello
Reversed String: olleh
