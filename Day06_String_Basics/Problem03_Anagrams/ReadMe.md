# Anagram Checker in Python

##  Description

This Python program checks whether two input strings are **anagrams** â€” i.e., whether they contain the exact same characters in a different order.

##  How It Works

- Takes two strings as input from the user.
- Converts both to lowercase to ensure case-insensitive comparison.
- Sorts the characters of both strings.
- Compares the sorted versions to determine if they are anagrams.

##  Example

Input:
First String: Listen
Second String: Silent

Output:
True
