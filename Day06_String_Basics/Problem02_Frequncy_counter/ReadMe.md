# Frequency Counter using Python

##  Description

This Python program takes an array of integers as input from the user and computes the frequency of each unique element.

##  How It Works

- Prompts the user to enter the length of the array.
- Takes integer input for each element.
- Calculates how many times each number appears in the array.
- Displays the result in a dictionary format.

##  Example

Enter the Length of Array = 6
Enter elements in the array:
1
2
2
3
1
4
Array = [1, 2, 2, 3, 1, 4]
Frequency Count: {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 1, 4: 1}
