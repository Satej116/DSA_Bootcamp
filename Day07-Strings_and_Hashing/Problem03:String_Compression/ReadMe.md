# String Compression Program

##  Description

This Python program performs **basic string compression** using the counts of repeated characters.

###  Logic

- Consecutive repeating characters are compressed into the character followed by the number of repetitions.
- If a character appears only once, it's added without a number.

> Example: `"aaabbc"` â†’ `"a3b2c"`

##  Features

- Accepts a string from the user.
- Compresses only **consecutive** duplicate characters.
- Displays the compressed result.
