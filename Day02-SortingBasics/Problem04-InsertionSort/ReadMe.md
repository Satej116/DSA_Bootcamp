# Insertion Sort in Python

This Python script performs **Insertion Sort** on a user-input array of integers. Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time.

## Features

- Accepts user-defined array length and elements.
- Implements Insertion Sort algorithm to sort elements in ascending order.
- Displays the sorted array after processing.

## How It Works

1. Prompts the user to enter the length of the array (must be greater than 1).
2. Prompts the user to input integer values for each element of the array.
3. Applies the Insertion Sort algorithm.
4. Prints the sorted array.

## Sample Input/Output

Enter the Length of Array = 5
Enter elements in the array:

10
5
2
8
1
Array = [10, 5, 2, 8, 1]
[1, 2, 5, 8, 10]
