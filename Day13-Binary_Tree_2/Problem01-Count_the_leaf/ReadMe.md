# Leaf Node Counter in a Binary Tree

## Description

This Python program counts the number of **leaf nodes** in a binary tree. A **leaf node** is a node that does not have any children (both left and right pointers are `None`).

## Features

- Defines a binary tree using a custom `Node` class
- Uses a recursive function `count()` to count all leaf nodes
- Demonstrates the concept with a sample binary tree
